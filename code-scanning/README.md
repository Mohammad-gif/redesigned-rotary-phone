# Code Scanning Workflows

GitHub code scanning is a developer-first, GitHub-native approach to easily find security vulnerabilities before they reach production. Before you can configure code scanning for a repository, you must enable code scanning by adding a GitHub Actions workflow to the repository. For more information, see [Enabling Code Scanning for a repository](/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/enabling-code-scanning-for-a-repository).
