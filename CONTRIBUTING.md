Hi there ðŸ‘‹ We are excited that you want to contribute a new workflow to this repo. By doing this you are helping people get up and running with GitHub Actions and that's cool ðŸ˜Ž.

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [project's open source license](LICENSE.md).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

There are few requirements for adding in a new workflow, which we'll need to review before we merge:

- Should be as simple as is needed for the service.
- There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.
- Should not send data to any 3rd party service except for the purposes of installing dependencies.
- Cannot use an Action that isn't in the `actions` organization.
- Cannot be to a paid service or product.

Thank you
